HI Power Spectra have been extracted from all three visbility data sets (EoR+noise, EoR+FG, EoR+noise+FG) for each observation times. 

The names of files having cylindrically and spherically averaged power spectra start with "ave2d" and "ave1d" respectively. Please ignore the string "wei1_win1" in the file names.

Binning of the power, (comoving) units, column order etc have been given in the desired outout format.
In cylindrically averaged results, 4 columns are -  k_perpendicular, k_parallel, mean power spectra, error on mean power spectra.
In spherically averaged results, 3 columns are - k, mean power spectra, error on mean power spectra.

In the error column, error bar corresponding to 95% confidence interval has been given.

Units are in comoving coordinates. 
k_perp, k_parallel, k are in units of h MPc^{-1}. 
Cylindrically averaged power spectrum and error are in units of K^2 h^{-3} Mpc^3.
Spherically averaged power spectrum and error are in units of mK^2.

Foreground avoidance techinique has been used while doing spherical averaging. Thus the k_parallel modes contaminated by foregrounds has been discarded while extracting HI power spectra (results having FG have lesser numbers of data points).
